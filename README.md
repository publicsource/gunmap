# gunmap

Here are the elements we want we to build for this map:
 
1) address geocoder from user input
 
2) buffer zone around point/feature (edited)

3) count points/features in buffer zone (edited)
 
4) find closest point/feature (edited)
 
5) point/feature clustering

6) color-coded points/features by type
